##View Variables plugin
Have you ever struggled to understand what script variables are available for you to put in your tagging or file renaming scripts, or what your use of $set in tagging scripts is actually doing?

Then this plugin is for you. It add's a context (right-click) menu item which shows a dialog listing all the variables available for a file.
